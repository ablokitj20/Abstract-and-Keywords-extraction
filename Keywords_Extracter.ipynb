Traditional preparation method needs a very long time annealing (usually 7 to 14 days) to form the right skutterudite phase. The annealing is especially critical for p-type filled skutterudites, since Fe4Sb12 need filler atoms to enter the cage to form a stable phase. In this work, we prepared Ce/Nd double filled p-type skutterudite material by directly ball-milling alloyed and quenched ingot. The results show that, by breaking the ingot into nano-sized particles, ball-milling greatly reduced the distance which filler atoms need to travel and hence accelerated the phase formation.
